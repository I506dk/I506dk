# The name's i506dk :wave:

### Coding, hacking, pentesting, breaking things? It's all part of the bigger picture.

## A little about me...
I'm a simple person, ***I just want to make the world a better place... One line of code at a time.***

My focus tends to revolve around automation. Automating defenses, automating exploits, or just automating annoying tasks? That just depends on the day.
I have a lot of interest in Neural Networks, AI, and combining them with the cybersecurity world.
And generally speaking, you can find me behind a computer screen using notepad++ and drinking lots of caffeine...

## Food for thought...
Hacking is an art, something that takes time to learn and perfect. And there is always something new to learn...
But the important part is how you think, not how much you know. Leave no stone unturned, and I guarantee you, you'll find something under one of them.
So never stop learning or exploring, and you'll be on your way.
